MyBot.cs file does not work by themself.
It need [Sebastian's chess program](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge) to run.

Current Specifications:
    Simple Minimax algorithm.
    Added alpha-beta pruning to minimax algorithm.
    Added move reordering for minimax algorithm.
    Simple evaluation function.




I aim to have a similar chess ai, visualizer and chess AI API in python at the end of the project.
I also aim to have different chess AI implementations.
